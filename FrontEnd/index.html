<p>Shut up and take my money! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
<p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. <strong> Checkmate.</strong> <em> Yeah, lots of people did.</em> Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</p>
<h2>Hey, whatcha watching?</h2>
<p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a flip!</li><li>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</li><li>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</h3>
<p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Can I use the gun? Bender?! You stole the atom. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</p>
<ul>
<li>But I've never been to the moon!</li><li>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</li><li>I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Bender?! You stole the atom. Ummm…to eBay? Who are those horrible orange men?</p>
<p>Actually, that's still true. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. You can see how I lived before I met you. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</p>
<p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Kids have names? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
<p>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! And then the battle's not so bad? Meh. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p>
<p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p>
<p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! I never loved you. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
<p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Hello Morbo, how's the family? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</p>
<p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>
<p>You're going to do his laundry? I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</p>
<p>Guess again. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! So, how 'bout them Knicks?</p>
<p>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.</p>

				<h2>Designer d'espace</h2>
				<p>Je raconte votre histoire, je valorise vos idées. Je vous accompagne de la conception à la livraison
					finale du chantier.</p>
				<p>Chaque projet sera étudié en commun, de façon à mettre en valeur les volumes, les matières et les
					couleurs dans le respect de l’esprit des lieux et le choix adapté des matériaux. Le suivi du
					chantier sera assuré dans le souci du détail, le respect du planning et du budget.</p>
				<p>En cas de besoin, une équipe pluridisciplinaire peut-être constituée : architecte DPLG,
